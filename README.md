# International-Standard-Atmosphere
Program where you can input the altitutde and get the corresponding pressure,temperature and density.

## ISA :-
It is an internationally accepted model which is used to get standard Pressure, Temperature, and Density at a particular altitude. It is used widely in aviation.

## How to use :-
- Fork and download the file and then run in your java complier(in my case Netbeans).
- Then run the file
- Input your altitude and get the results.

## Limitations :-
- The effect of gravity is neglected because the error is around 3%.
- The maximum height entered can be 50000 m.

## Licensing :-
This repository is under Standard MIT License.

## Future Advancememts :-
- To reduce the code length using some other funciton.
- Increase the height limit.
- Include some more parameter whic hcan be calculated.
